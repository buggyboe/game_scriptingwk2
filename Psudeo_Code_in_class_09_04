ACTIVITY 1
______________________________

variable = user_input 
variable = new_output

start loop
  ( print: prompt user to input word or phrase

    use loop to check through each letter
      (
        IF ASCII is between 97-122, THEN subtract 32. assign to variable NewOutput
        ELSE Print: please use only lower case letters.
      )
end loop

Print: NewOutput

ACTIVITY 2
______________________________

variable = num1
variable = num2
varibale = sum

start loop 
  ( prompt user for first number. store in num1
    prompt user for second number. store in num2
    check to make sure both are integers, if not then print "please input whole numbers only."
   
    num1 + num2 = sum
  )
end loop

Print sum

______________________________
ACTIVITY 3
______________________________

variable = nums
variable = sum
variable (boolean) = user_input

start loop
  ( Print: prompt user to give you a number- stored in nums
    Check to make sure num is an integer, if not Print: "Please input a whole number."

    if user_input = true, then get another number, 
    if user_input false, add all nums together, assign to sums 
  )
end loop

Print: sum

ACTIVITY 4
______________________________

variable = max_num
variable = min_num = 0
variable = output_num
variable (boolean) = user_choice

start loop
  (prompt user to pick a maximum num. store in max_num. check to make sure max_num is a whole number.
   set up generator to pick random number betwwen max_num chosen by user and 0.
   assign num to output_num
   print output num.
      (prompt user to either input yes or no for a second num. store in user_choice.
       if user_choice = true, repeat loop. if user choice = false, break loop
       check to make sure inputted response is a string)
  )
end loop

ACTIVITY 5
______________________________

varibale = rand_num
variable = right
variable = left

start loop (repeated 10 times)
  (create a random num generator that prints from 1-100. assign to rand_num
   take rand_num and divide by 2. 
   IF rand_num is divisible by 2, print "RIGHT"
   ELSE print "LEFT"
  count how many times right and left was printed, and assign to right and left variables
  print number of "right" and number of "left"
  )
end loop
