REQUIREMENTS

Start with the game loop to create this simple game.

Here are the minimum requirements for your game:

*Computer picks a number from 1 to 100.
*User tries to guess the computer number.
*User is allowed a certain number of attempts (7)
*If user guesses correctly, user wins.
If user does not guess correctly within the allowed number of attempts, user loses.
Print a winning or losing message after each game.
Allow the user to replay as many times as they want.

________________________________________________________________

variable = rand
variable = user_guess
variable (boolean) = user_choice
variable = counter

need a random generator from 1-100
user needs to input number between 1-100. needs to be checked to make sure its the correct value
loop needs to repeat 7 times unless user wins. if 7 attempts are reached, game is lost
if user input is equal to number chosen by random generator, win is triggered. 

win/lose needs to reprint each time
user should be able to repeat
