REQUIREMENTS

Start with the game loop to create this simple game.

Here are the minimum requirements for your game:

*Computer picks a number from 1 to 100.
*User tries to guess the computer number.
*User is allowed a certain number of attempts (7)
If user guesses correctly, user wins.
If user does not guess correctly within the allowed number of attempts, user loses.
Print a winning or losing message after each game.
Allow the user to replay as many times as they want.

________________________________________________________________

variable = rand
variable = user_guess

for loop starts (repeat 7 times if rand /= user_guess)
  ( set up random generator between 1-100 and assign to variable rand
    print "Guess a number between 1-100. You are allowed 7 attempts." assign user input to variable user_guess
